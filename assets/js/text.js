textDroidShot = ["ow! that wasn't very nice. i'm not a target droid, you know.", "careful where you're aiming that thing! i don't have a built-in shield, you know.", "hey! watch where you're shooting, you clumsy lump of meat!", "i hope that was an accident. otherwise, i may have to report you to the rebel alliance for droid abuse.", "well, i'm not feeling too good about our chances now. maybe we should stick to diplomacy instead of blasters."]
textGameStarts = ["remember, the force will be with you...but so will a bunch of imperial troops. good luck.", "rise and shine, buttercup! it's time to save the galaxy. or at least try not to get vaporized by stormtroopers.", "welcome, brave adventurer! you're about to embark on a journey that's more thrilling than a podracing match on steroids.", "listen up, hotshot. the fate of the galaxy is in your hands, so try not to drop it or anything.", "well, well, well. look who decided to show up for the party. i hope you brought your blaster and your best one-liners, because we're gonna need both."]
textTargetHit = ["nice shot! but don't get cocky, kid. there are plenty more stormtroopers where that one came from.", "looks like you're off to a great start. but be careful, stormtroopers tend to have terrible aim. you don't want to ruin their record.", "great job taking out those droids. they're about as threatening as a gonk droid in a footrace.", "that's one less stormtrooper to worry about. don't get too excited, though. there are still more of them than there are ewoks on endor.", "nice shot! i almost thought i was going to have to do some work around here.", "good job, kid. you're like a young han solo in training. but try not to get cocky, okay?"]
textTargetMiss = ["i think it's time to reprogram your combat protocols. or maybe just stick to playing dejarik.", "well, you almost had it. better luck next time. or maybe get your eyes checked?", "you missed the target by a parsec! just kidding, i have no idea what a parsec is.", "hmm, i think we might need to recalibrate your blaster. or your aim. or maybe both.", "wow, you're really good at shooting everything except the target. maybe try closing your eyes next time?", "i hate to break it to you, but i don't think the empire is intimidated by your shooting skills. let's step it up a bit, okay?"]
textTimeout = ["sorry to break it to you, but the action doesn't just pause when you decide to take a nap. try to keep up, okay?", "well, i guess the force wasn't with you this time. better luck next round, my young padawan.", "oh no, time flies when you're having fun, doesn't it? but unfortunately, the rebellion doesn't give out extra credit for tardiness.", "time's up, buttercup! but don't worry, you can always hit the reset button and pretend like it never happened."]
